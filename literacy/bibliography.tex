  abstract  = "AbstractThe application of gamified elements to PBL to promote
               student engagement has not been systematically described. Hence,
               we conducted a review based on Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage
               scoping review framework, involving research question
               identification, relevant study identification, study selection,
               data charting, and result collating and reporting. We searched
               three databases using five search terms combined with a Boolean
               operator: ``problem-based learning'' AND ``persuasive OR gamify
               OR gamification OR game''. The initial pool of 5532 sources was
               evaluated according to the eligibility criteria, and 14 original
               articles were selected for the final data extraction. A content
               analysis was performed, and several persuasive gamification
               elements for PBL were identified. The results were reported
               using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
               Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. The analysis unearthed six
               main categories of persuasive gamification elements, which have
               been proven to be effective in the achievement of learning
               outcomes: high-fidelity simulation, inquisitive exploration,
               collaborative learning, interactive instruction, guidance and
               feedback, and rewards. These findings highlight the persuasive
               gamify elements that can be incorporated to support the active
               learning and engagement of students in PBL, thus preparing them
               to be lifelong, self-directed learners.",
